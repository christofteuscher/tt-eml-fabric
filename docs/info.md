## How it works

This is an analog computing tile: a chain of two **EML cells**, each
computing `exp(u) − ln(v)` in current mode using translinear NPN loops
(the "single operator" of Odrzywołek's EML formulation).  Weighted
connections between cells are radix-4, all-unit-device current MDACs
(4 magnitude bits + sign per weight), and the whole fabric is biased from
an on-chip PTAT core with a 3-bit trimmed reference resistor.

The chain is `x_in` → CELL A → γ weight → CELL B → `out_CELLB`.  Only the
final output is observable: with three analog pins there is no room for
stage taps, so a wrong answer cannot be localised to CELL A, the coupling
or CELL B.

Each cell computes `eml(u,v) = exp(u) − ln(v)`.  Every weight is a signed
radix-4 current MDAC built from identical unit devices; the weights set
`u` and `v` at each cell input, and the γ weight scales the coupling from
CELL A into CELL B.

### Configuration — a 29-bit scan chain (3.3 V logic, `sky130_fd_sc_hvl`)

| bits | function |
|---|---|
| `[24:0]` | five 5-bit signed weights: `A.u`, `A.v`, `B.u`, `B.v`, `B.gamma` |
| `[27:25]` | R_ptat trim (3 bits, 8 codes) |
| `[28]` | chain tail — appears on `scan_out` |

Each 5-bit weight is `w[4]` = sign, `w[3:0]` = magnitude m, value = m/4
(full scale ±3.75 unit currents).  The magnitude is **two base-4 digits,
binary within each digit**: `m = (a0 + 2·a1) + (b0 + 2·b1)/4`.

The chain is **latchless**: the analog follows the shift register
directly, so program first, then measure — values wiggle harmlessly while
a word shifts.

### Analog pins — currents, not voltages

| pin | net | role |
|---|---|---|
| `ua[0]` | `x_in` | input current |
| `ua[1]` | `iref_in` | override/augment the internal bias reference (the chip self-biases; this is for characterisation) |
| `ua[2]` | `out_CELLB` | final output of the chain |


## How to test

1. Power up (1.8 V digital + 3.3 V VAPWR).  Release `rst_n` — the config
   chain resets to a safe all-zero state (all weights off).
2. Shift 29 configuration bits into `ui[0]` (scan_data), clocked on the
   rising edge of **`ui[2]`** (scan_clk).  `uo[0]` (scan_out) echoes the
   chain 29 clocks later — shift 58 clocks and compare the second 29 to
   verify programming.
   *`ui[2]`, not `ui[1]`: `ui[1]` sits off the analog macro's 0.6 µm
   routing grid, so no via could be placed beside it.*
3. Drive `ua[0]` (x_in) with the input current: unit current is 0.5 µA,
   useful range roughly 0.1–6.5 µA.
4. Measure `ua[2]` (out_CELLB) for the chain result.
5. Optionally trim the PTAT current via bits `[27:25]` (8 monotonic codes
   spanning 15–50 kΩ, ~127 % of design current; nominal at code `100`)
   and observe the effect on any output.

No clock is required beyond the scan clock you provide; the analog is
continuous-time.

## Known limitations

- **Weight monotonicity is likely, not guaranteed.**  Each radix-4 digit
  is binary rather than thermometer (the thermometer decoder was removed
  to fit the config routing), so a code step at an inter-digit carry is a
  *difference* between matched devices instead of simply adding a leg.
  Simulated (schematic level): nominal DNL −0.139/+0.057 LSB; across 70
  mismatch samples **0 were non-monotonic**, with the per-sample worst
  DNL distributed mean −0.276, σ 0.190 LSB, worst observed −0.981 against
  the −1.0 limit.  That puts the limit ~3.8σ out — but note −0.981 turned
  up once in 70 samples where a Gaussian at that σ predicts nearer 1 in
  3800, so the tail is heavier than normal and 70 samples cannot resolve
  it.  The margin is real but not large.  If weight sweeps show a flat or
  reversed step, suspect codes 4, 8, 12 of a digit pair before suspecting
  your setup.
- **The exp term is correct as of this build: `exp(0.967·u)`.**  An earlier
  build computed `exp(1.23·u)` because the poly resistors were sized by
  `L/W × rsheet`, which ignores end resistance (~24 % low).  Corrected.
  Measured 2026-08-14 on the layout-matched netlist (`emlcell_b_sim12.inc`),
  tt, 27 °C, `u = −1 … +1.25`, `v` held at 1:

      io = 1.101 · exp(0.967·u) − 0.009      max residual 0.0004 units

  It is a clean exponential — the residual is four ten-thousandths of a unit.
  The coefficient drifts slightly across the range (0.931 at `u = +0.6` to
  0.955 at `u = −1.25`), so it is not perfectly pure, but close.
  *Earlier revisions quoted 0.96; that came from a schematic bench and was
  ~3.5 % optimistic.  0.927 is the die figure.*
- **THE ln ARGUMENT IS NOT `v`.  The cell computes `ln(v + 2.57)` up to scale.**
  Measured 2026-08-14 on the layout-matched netlist (`emlcell_b_sim12.inc`,
  derived from `lvsref/emlcell_b_flat.spice`, which LVS-matches the shipped
  layout), tt, 27 °C, over `v = 0.5 … 4`:

  | fitted against | result | max residual |
  |---|---|---|
  | `ln(v + 2.55)` | `2.478 − 1.094·ln(v + 2.547)` | **0.0002 units** |
  | `ln(v)` | `1.05 − 0.42·ln(v)` | 0.078 units |

  Read the first row: as a log amplifier the cell is close to ideal — slope
  −1.094 against its true argument, residual two ten-thousandths of a unit.
  It is only the *argument* that is offset.

  **Mechanism.**  The layout hard-wires a bias pedestal the schematic bench
  never modelled: `XLPA` puts a fixed 936 nA (1.872 units) on the `nv`
  transdiode, and the reference leg `XLPB_LVR` carries 1394 nA (2.789 units).
  That accounts for roughly 1.87 units of offset.  **The measured offset on
  the shipping (unbuffered) cell is 2.57**, so the pedestal explains most but
  not all of it; the remaining ~0.7 units is not yet accounted for and is an
  open item.  The pedestal model was validated against the *buffered* build,
  where it matched the local slope at every point; it has not been re-fitted
  for this one.  What is directly measured, and what should be relied on, is
  the fit in the table above.

  **How to use it.**  Pre-map the input as `v_ext = a·v_eff − 2.57` (units
  of the 0.5 µA reference; `a` is absorbed by the compiler's alpha).  This has to happen in the compiler or the drive
  electronics: `ln(v + 2.57)` is **not** `k·ln(v)` for any `k`, so no output
  gain or offset trim recovers it.  `silicon/README.md:158` records
  this as the original design intent — "ln input becomes ln((v+2)/3);
  constants absorbed by alpha/compiler" — it simply was never carried into
  this document.

  **CORRECTION.**  Earlier revisions of this file claimed `1.06 − 1.05·ln(v)`
  with a 0.019-unit residual and a usable range of `|error| < 0.05` for
  `v ≥ 1`.  All three claims were wrong.  That figure came from a schematic
  bench (`char/_v2d_lay2.inc`) which (a) omits the pedestal legs the layout
  generates internally, and (b) is byte-identical to `char/_v2d_quiet.inc`
  and self-oscillates, so the number was read off a DC equilibrium the bench
  does not occupy.  Time-averaging that bench through its limit cycle gives
  `0.83 − 1.38·ln(v)` with a 0.53-unit residual.  The statement that the
  slope only collapses below `v ≈ 0.35` was also wrong: without the input
  mapping the apparent slope varies continuously across the whole range,
  −0.15 at `v = 0.35` to −0.63 at `v = 4`, never reaching −1.

  **A source-follower buffer was briefly shipped and has been REVERTED.**
  Between 2026-08-13 and 2026-08-14 this repository carried a build with a
  source follower (`MSF`, W16 L1) plus a 0.5 µA sink (`MBM`, W4 L8) added to
  the two ln servos, intended to fix an apparent slope error.  That apparent
  error was an artifact of fitting against `ln(v)` instead of the true
  argument — the unbuffered cell was already a clean logarithm — and the
  buffer made the servo loop **unstable**: a sustained ~7.2 MHz limit cycle
  from the DC operating point with no stimulus, 1.37 units peak-to-peak at
  the output for `v = 1` (126 % of the signal), confirmed under both
  trapezoidal and Gear-2 integration and by active perturbation.  Reverting
  either added device restores 0.00000 units of ripple with the DC law
  unchanged.  The current GDS is the unbuffered cell and is stable.

  **RESISTOR SEGMENTATION — why these differ from earlier revisions by ~4 %.**
  The layout draws `RU` and `RLN` as FOUR series bodies of `L = 11.44 µm`;
  the simulation netlists and LVS references lump each as a single
  `L = 45.76 µm` device.  Those are not the same resistor: each body carries
  its own ~741 Ω of end resistance, so 4 × 11.44 measures **53.75 kΩ**
  against 51.53 kΩ for the lump, **+4.31 %**.  Simulating the segmented form
  moves the ln slope −1.145 → **−1.094** and the exp coefficient
  0.927 → **0.967**, i.e. both ~4 % CLOSER to ideal than previously
  published.  Post-layout extraction confirms the split: parasitic R and C
  contribute only 0.01 % (ln) and 0.35 % (exp) at DC, so essentially all of
  the difference is the segmentation, not the parasitics.
  *The corner, temperature and Monte Carlo figures below were taken on the
  LUMPED netlist and carry the same ~4 % systematic; their spreads and
  trends are unaffected.*
- **Per-cell output level varies by 24 % (1 sigma).  This is the accuracy
  floor.**  440 Monte Carlo samples of the layout-matched netlist
  (`tt_mm` plus the four skew corners), measuring `io` at `v = 1, u = 0`:

      mean 1.098 units, sigma 0.266 units = 24.3 %
      observed range 0.446 .. 1.838 units over 440 samples

  The peak-to-peak spread is 1.27x the nominal output itself.  It is
  **mismatch-limited, not process-limited** — `tt_mm` alone produces the full
  24.3 % and the skew corners add nothing — so it will **not** average out
  across the fabric: every cell draws independently.
  The *shape* is unaffected: under full mismatch the log and antilog fits
  still hold to ~2.5e-4 and ~3.2e-4 units respectively.  Mismatch translates
  the curve without bending it.  So a cell remains an excellent log amplifier
  with an uncertain gain and offset.
  **Consequence: treat every cell output as needing per-cell calibration.**
  Using a raw cell output as a quantitative value carries ~24 % 1-sigma
  error.  This cannot be trimmed out in the current silicon (it is set by
  device area in the level-setting legs) and it is not a corner or binning
  issue.
- **Useful temperature window is roughly −8 °C to +54 °C.**  The cell has no
  thermal-voltage compensation, so its scale factor tracks absolute
  temperature by construction: `k_ln` is PTAT (measured, it tracks
  `k_ln(27 °C)·T/300 K` to within 0.6 % at every temperature from −40 to
  +125 °C) and the exp coefficient is the reciprocal, ~1/T.  Measured `k_ln`
  runs 0.887 at −40 °C through 1.151 at 27 °C to 1.520 at +125 °C — a 72 %
  swing, of which only 0.54 % is process.
  This is what an uncompensated bipolar translinear pair does; it is a design
  limit, not a defect.  Because the drift is thermal rather than process,
  guardbanding or binning does not help — only a PTAT-referenced gain trim or
  a temperature-tracking reference would.  The exp path binds the window.
- **Stability: verified across the full box.**  Zero-stimulus transients from
  the DC operating point show `i(VOUT)` peak-to-peak = 0.000e+00 at all 25
  corner × temperature conditions and in all 440 Monte Carlo samples.  Worst
  fit residual anywhere in the corner matrix is 6.6e-4 units.
  *(An earlier build with a source-follower buffer oscillated at ~7.2 MHz and
  was reverted — see the note further down.)*
- **Bias-current tolerance is the tightest operating constraint.**  The
  reference current sets BOTH transfer coefficients — they are properties of
  the bias, not of the topology.  Scaling the whole bias generator gives
  `exp` coefficient `B = 1.853 x I[uA]`, constant to 0.5 %, with the ln slope
  moving inversely.  Measured on the layout-matched netlist at tt / 27 C,
  varying `pbias` alone:

  | pbias | ln slope k | usable v range |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0.25 uA | -1.309 | 0.25 … **≈1.8** |
  | 0.35 uA | -1.215 | 0.25 … **≈3.4** |
  | **0.50 uA (nominal)** | **-1.151** | **full 0.25 … 4** |
  | 0.70 uA | -1.115 | full |
  | 1.00 uA | -1.094 | full, residual 19x better |

  **A −30 % bias error already clips the top of the input range** — the output
  crosses zero at v ≈ 3.4 and goes negative beyond it.  Nominal 0.5 uA sits at
  the LOW EDGE of the range that keeps the full v span usable.  Above nominal
  the log conformance actually improves (max residual 1.8e-5 units at 1 uA),
  at the cost of DC level and MDAC headroom.  This is what the 3-bit R_ptat
  trim (bits `[27:25]`) is for; use it.
- **Output loading: only DC compliance and bandwidth, never stability.**
  `out` is the drain of three devices and the gate or source of none, so it
  sits outside every feedback loop and a load cannot move a loop pole.
  Measured `R_out` = 7.1 MΩ, `C_self` ≈ 24–40 fF; |Zout| is a single
  non-peaking pole for every load tested up to 100 nF.
  - Resistive: `v(out) = 0.9 V + io·R_L`.  At ≤ 100 kΩ the cost is ≤ 1.5 % on
    the ln slope; at 1 MΩ the node reaches 1.38 V and costs 12.7 %.
  - Capacitive: sets the output pole at `1/(2π·7.1 MΩ·C_L)` — 22 kHz at 1 pF,
    2.6 kHz at 10 pF, ~22 Hz at 1 nF.  DC is untouched.
  No load, supply, reference or bias condition in 43 tested destabilised the
  cell.
- **PSRR is 0.113 units/V (56.5 nA/V), flat to ~10 kHz.**  That is ~10 % of
  the DC output per volt, i.e. ~1 % per 100 mV of supply ripple.  It degrades
  above 10 kHz: x3.6 at 1 MHz and x22 at 10 MHz, still rising.  Supply
  sensitivity of the transfer itself is small — over 3.0–3.6 V the ln slope
  moves 0.21 % and the DC level +6.4 %.  Both references are far less
  critical: ±10 % on `vrefb` moves the slope 0.08 %, and ±10 % on `ve` leaves
  it unchanged to four decimals.
- **The thermistor-linearisation figure has not been re-validated.**  The
  "residual 1.1 % of span" result was obtained with the earlier
  three-digit thermometer weight; this build has two digits, binary.
- All results quoted here are simulation, schematic-level except where
  stated.  Nothing has been measured on silicon.

## External hardware

A source-measure unit (or one current source + one current meter) for the

The paper shows that the single binary operator

```
eml(x, y) = exp(x) − ln(y)
```

together with the constant 1 generates the standard scientific-calculator
repertoire — constants (`e`, `π`, `i`), arithmetic (`+ − × /`,
exponentiation) and the transcendental and algebraic functions.  For
example `eˣ = eml(x, 1)` and `ln x = eml(1, eml(eml(1, x), 1))`.  Every
expression becomes a binary tree of identical nodes under the grammar
`S → 1 | eml(S, S)`.

This chip is a hardware realisation of that node: two `eml` cells with
programmable weights, so a depth-2 tree can be evaluated in continuous
time rather than symbolically.
